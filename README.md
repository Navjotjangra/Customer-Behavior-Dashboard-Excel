# Customer Behavior Analysis Dashboard in Excel

An interactive dashboard built in Microsoft Excel to analyze retail sales data, uncover customer patterns, and provide actionable insights for business growth.

# üöÄ Project Overview

This project aims to solve a common business challenge: understanding a complex dataset of customer transactions to make informed strategic decisions. The dashboard I created segments customers, analyzes revenue streams, and evaluates the effectiveness of a loyalty program.

The primary goals were to identify:
* The most valuable customer segments.
* The performance of different purchase channels (In-Store vs. Online).
* The correlation between the company's loyalty program and customer satisfaction.

üí° Key Insights & Recommendations

The analysis yielded three core business insights:

* üéØ The Gold Segment: High-income customers aged 18-27 are the top spenders.
    * Recommendation: Launch targeted digital marketing campaigns and curated product collections for this demographic.

* ü§ù Loyalty Pays Off: Customers enrolled in the loyalty program exhibit significantly higher satisfaction scores, which directly correlates with repeat business.
    * Recommendation: Double down on the loyalty program, offering enhanced rewards to boost enrollment and retention.

*üåê The Digital Opportunity: While in-store sales are currently the primary revenue source, online channels are showing strong growth, especially in high-value categories.
    * Recommendation: Strategically invest in enhancing the e-commerce experience and promoting online-exclusive offers to accelerate this digital expansion.
